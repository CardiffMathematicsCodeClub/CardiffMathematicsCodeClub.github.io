This workshop will give a lightning fast overview of blender and what can
be done with it. We will then proceed to set up a scene ready to render
out an animation from multiple angles.

Topcs covered:

- Blender's UI, Customization and Settings
- Basic modelling, modifiers and constraints
- Basic materials, lighting and camera setup
- Basic animation principles
- Basic rendering

The topics above will be covered in various levels of detail depending on time
available and what animation I decide to show you - I haven't properly decided
yet.

Blender is available [here](http://blender.org) for Windows, Mac and Linux

A mouse is not required, but recommended!
