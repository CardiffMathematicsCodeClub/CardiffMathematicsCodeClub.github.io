This workshop will introduce the very basics of using the command line. This
serves as the basis for further workshops as the command line is used in all
aspects of this.

Basic things covered include:

- Moving around;
- Copying, moving and deleting files;
- Finding out where you are;
- Other stuff.

You can use your [cloud.sagemath](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) account but there
are native options:

- Linux: you already have a terminal;
- Mac OSX: you already have a terminal;
- Windows: install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and via that you will
  get [git-bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
