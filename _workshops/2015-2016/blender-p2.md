This workshop follows on from the last workshop where we will take the two views
of your animation that you rendered (or use my copy if you didn't) and edit them
together into a single video. If we get around to it we may even add some sound
to the final video.

Don't worry too much if you missed the first one you are still welcome to join in
the topics we will cover here don't really require you knowing what we did last
time.

Topics covered include:

- A review of Blender's UI and settings
- Introduction to the video editor
- Introduction to producing final videos in blender.

Blender is available [here](http://blender.org) for Windows, Mac and Linux

Again a mouse is not necessary but recommended!
