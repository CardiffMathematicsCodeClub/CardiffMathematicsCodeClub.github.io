// Lines starting with two slahes (//) like this one are ignored by everything, you can
// write whatever you like here

// Just ignore these dashes, they are needed for Jekyyl to notice your theme and generate it

// This tells the browser that we use UTF-8 encoding
@charset utf-8;

// Here you can define any variables you want to use in your theme, for example
// $background-color: #000000;


// Uncomment this line if you want to use the default theme used by the site
// @import "_layout"

// Any extra files you want to use in your theme have to go in the _sass/_themes/_THEMENAME/ folder
// that should have been made for you if you used the rake newtheme command.

// Import any of your theme files using the following

// @import "_themes/_THEMENAME/_FILE",
//         "_themes/_THEMENAME/_ANOTHERFILE"

// Notice how you can combine multiple imports into one? just make sure they are all separated by a comma
// and the last one is followed by nothing.

// Be sure to check out the tutorials on the website for more help! happy themeing :)
