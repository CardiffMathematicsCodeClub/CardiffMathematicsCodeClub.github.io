With Vince and Jason still at Python Nambia, it fell to me, Alex and Tim to run Code Club in their stead.
However, due to prior comitments Alex could not make it to code club.

![Or behind my desk?](/res/blog_pics/WHERE-IS-EVERYONE-pic3.jpg)

As you can tell they missed a lot. Me and Tim were rushed off our feet with the amount of first years :)
