There is now a Cardiff Python user group. Whilst it is expected that the main
subject of conversations will be Python related, no doubt we will talk about
anything that's of interest to the code club.

Meetings will be once a month and the first one is already planned for the 13th
of October. Take a look at the website:
[pydiff.github.io/](http://pydiff.github.io/), follow the [twitter
account](https://twitter.com/PyDiff) and join the [the gitter
conversation](https://gitter.im/PyDiff/PyDiff.github.io).
