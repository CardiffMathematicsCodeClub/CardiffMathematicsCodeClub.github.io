Last week, during a Computing for Mathematics tutorial, Vince came up with what he thought was
a brilliant idea.

It was that during a Code Club session, we would each go up to a laptop that was hooked up to
the projector and **type one line of code and then walk away**. We would do this a number of times
and then run the code.

So as he was not here for that weeks Code Club, he decided to do it in the last session. It was
decided that the editor we would use would be Atom as it is a usable and friendly editor unlike
Vim. We therefore had to use my laptop and Sam and Geraint then spent all of their `prep time`
working ways they could mess up my terminal. ***I had expected better of Sam.***

The code from our first go:  
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Huaraz2/b624be9a6e54ec179cfc.js"></script>

the code from our second go:  
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Huaraz2/9e97cbb2e19a21b2ae30.js"></script>
