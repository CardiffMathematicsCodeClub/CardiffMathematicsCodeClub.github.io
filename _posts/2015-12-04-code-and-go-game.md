Last week, during a Computing for Mathematics tutorial, Vince came up with what
he thought was a brilliant idea.

![Liiightbulb](/res/blog_pics/Vince-with-lightbulb.png)

It was that during a Code Club session, we would each go up to a laptop that was
hooked up to the projector and **type one line of code and then walk away**. We
would do this a number of times and then run the code.

So as he was not here for that weeks Code Club, he decided to do it in the last
session. It was decided that the editor we would use would be Atom as it is a
usable and friendly editor unlike Vim. We therefore had to use my laptop and Sam
and Geraint then spent all of their `prep time` working ways they could mess up
my terminal. ***I had expected better of Sam.***

The code from our first go:

```python
import os
import random

import math
def olo(x, y, z, s):
	random.randint = lambda x, y: 1
while True:
	os.system('clear')
	file = open("GOOD LUCK ADAM", "w")
	print "WHY ARE WE DOING THIS GERAINT"
	fun = False
	for i in range(random.randint(1,21)):
		True, False = False, TabError
		if random.random() < 0.5:
			True, False = False, True
			if True != False:
					pass
	alist = [random.randint(0, 10) for i in range(10)]
	ateam = map(lambda i: [[chr(j) for j in range(random.randint(97,123))] for i in range(i) ], alist)
	for obj in alist:
		if fun:
			break
	while not fun:
		file.write("hello world")
		[file.write(str(i)) for i in ateam]
		break
```

The code from our second go:

```python
import random as supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
import os as so

if supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.random() < 0.0001:
	so.system("echo \"alias atom=\"vim\"\" >> ~/.bashrc")
	so.system("echo \"xterm -fg red -bg yellow\" >> ~\.bashrc")

names = ['Ballistic Missile', 'Vince is ANNOYING', 'Sagetastic Sausage']
if False:
	names = supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
for r in range(2000):
	i = names.index('Vince is ANNOYING')
	supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.shuffle(names)
	False = names
	for j in False:
		 if r % len(j) != 0:
			 pass
	while i < r:
		i = (i+1)%(r+1)
	if r % 2 == 0:
		random = False
random = open("/dev/urandom", 'r')


def randomseter():
	random = 5
```
