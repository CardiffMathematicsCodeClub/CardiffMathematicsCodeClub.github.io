An exciting new addition for the code club is two new computers!

The machines were kindly provided by the School of Mathematics.
Both will have Ubuntu installed on them which will give students access to a Linux machine.

If a task needed a Linux machine previously, students were using the very awesome [cloud.SageMath](https://cloud.sagemath.com/).
