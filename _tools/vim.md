### Overview

[Vim][vim] is a text edtior developed by Bram Moolenaar and was first released in 1991.
It was inspired by the vi editior which is commonly found on [UNIX][unix] systems and
its name actually stands for Vi IMproved. Vim is available both in the terminal and as
its own window on your desktop.

Vim is different from many other editors thay you see since it's a modal editor. This means
key combinations will do something different depending on which mode you are in, this allows
vim not to use any menus. This greatly increases the learning curve but once, you have grasped
the basics it arguably makes you much more efficient at editing text.
