After being decimated in the first week the Atom editor came out swinging with live code publishing,
real time markdown preview and modifying many lines of code simultaneously. But could it hold off the
newcomer Sublime?

For this battle we had 6 participants with 4 weapons of choice:

- Adam: Atom
- Vince: Atom
- Sam: Vim
- Alex: Emacs
- Geraint: Sublime
- Hannah: Sublime


This post will briefly show/discuss what they showed:

## Adam

### Making & publishing your own theme

After nothing worked and subsequently getting decimated by both
Vim and Emacs in episode I, Adam knew that he would have to come
out fighting if he was to even stand a chance of matching/beating Vince.

Adam therefore decided to showcase and perform a live publish of the
[syntax theme][The Matrix] he had been working on for the past year
for his 1<sup>st</sup> 'trick'.

Despite a few teething problems, the pics not loading correctly and
not being able to find it at first on the atom website, it went well.

### Using git-control

The 2<sup>nd</sup> trick Adam showed was a package called git-control
which provides a GUI interface to manage all commonly-used git commands.

Using the command <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> Adam opened
up the GUI and having connected it to the codeclub 'Project Folder', he
committed and pushed up the quote of the session live.

## Vince

Vince decided to throw a curve ball and chose a different weapon: he used atom.

### Using the built in markdown preview functionality

Markdown is an excellent language for quickly writing documents. Take a look at
this video that more or less shows the entirety of the markdown syntax in about
12 minutes:


<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6A5EpqqDOdk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </figure>
</div>

In atom you can simply press `ctrl+shift+M` and it automatically opens a
preview pane that updates as you type. Here's a screenshot (showing me write
the current blog post using Adam's cool new theme):

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/markdown-preview.png)

This is a nice example of some of the built in capabilities of atom.

### Movement and multiple cursors

Atom has some great built in functionality to help you type faster. **If your
editor is not helping you type less you are not using it right**. I've heard
some people say that really with you editor you should only ever type a given
word once, I'm not quite there yet with my favourite editor but am getting
closer :)

For this trick Vince showed how you could select multiple lines and then have
multiple cursors which helped him fix some docstrings quickly. Here's a
screenshot:

I also shared various other little tricks, such as typing `ctrl+F2` to set a
bookmark and then using `F2` to cycle between bookmarks to move back and forth
between specific spots you're working on.

To find out some of the cool things markdown can do out of the box, take a look
at the [documentation
pages](https://atom.io/docs/v1.0.19/using-atom-moving-in-atom).
