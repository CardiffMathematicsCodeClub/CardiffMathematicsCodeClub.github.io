After being decimated in the first week the Atom editor came out swinging with live code publishing,
real time markdown preview and modifying many lines of code simultaneously. But could it hold off the
newcomer Sublime?

For this battle we had 6 participants with 4 weapons of choice:

- Adam: Atom
- Vince: Atom
- Sam: Vim
- Alex: Emacs
- Geraint: Sublime
- Hannah: Sublime


This post will briefly show/discuss what they showed:

## Adam

### Making & publishing your own theme

After nothing worked and subsequently getting decimated by both
Vim and Emacs in episode I, Adam knew that he would have to come
out fighting if he was to even stand a chance of matching/beating Vince.

Adam therefore decided to showcase and perform a live publish of the
[syntax theme][The Matrix] he had been working on for the past year
for his 1<sup>st</sup> 'trick'.

Despite a few teething problems, the pics not loading correctly and
not being able to find it at first on the atom website, it went well.


### Using git-control

The 2<sup>nd</sup> trick Adam showed was a package called git-control
which provides a GUI interface to manage all commonly-used git commands.  

Using the command <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> Adam opened
up the GUI and having connected it to the codeclub 'Project Folder', he
commited and pushed up the quote of the session live.
