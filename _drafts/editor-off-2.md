After being decimated in the first week the Atom editor came out swinging with live code publishing,
real time markdown preview and modifying many lines of code simultaneously. But could it hold off the
newcomer Sublime?

For this battle we had 6 participants with 4 weapons of choice:

- Adam: Atom
- Vince: Atom
- Sam: Vim
- Alex: Emacs
- Geraint: Sublime
- Hannah: Sublime


This post will briefly show/discuss what they showed:

## Adam :smiling_imp:

### Making & publishing your own theme

After nothing worked for me and subsequently getting decimated by both Vim and Emacs in episode I,
I knew that I had to come out fighting if I was to even stand a chance of matching/beating Vince.
I therefore decided to showcase and perform a live publish of the [syntax theme][The Matrix]
I had been working on for the past year. Despite a few teething problems, the pics not loading correctly and not
 being able to find it at first on the atom website, I feel that it went really well.
