Code Club is a place where like minded people who are passionate about programming can get together
and hang out, talk about coding in general and work on any projects that they have
in mind, whether it be solo or part of a team. Code Club is the ideal place to
improve your skills as a programmer while enjoying the pleasant company of others who share your interests.

Can't wait to come along? Well we meet in M/0.33, 17:00 - 19:00 on a Thursday, in the School of Mathematics building. <br/>
Do you think it sounds like a great idea, but are looking for an excuse to turn up? Then be sure to check out our
