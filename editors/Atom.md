Atom is stated as the hackable editor for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Unlike other editors such as vim, ed,
vi or nano; atom cannot be run in the terminal.

There are loads of cool packages that you can download for atom, such as '[git-control][atomgit]' - see gif
 below, '[color picker][color]' - allows you to easily change the hex code,
 '[minimap][map]' - A preview of the full source code to name a few.  Can't find the package that you
 need/want, just go ahead and [create it][makepackage].

There are loads of [syntax and UI themes][themes] for you to download to make your Atom more personal to you.
Again if you don't like any of the presets/ones available to download you can also
[create your own][maketheme]. Also, as you can see in the screenshot below you are able to edit any of the
packages/themes you download allowing you to make atom more personal.
