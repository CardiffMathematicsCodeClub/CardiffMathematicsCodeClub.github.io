# Cardiff School of Mathematics Code Club
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CardiffMathematicsCodeClub/CardiffMathematicsCodeClub.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CardiffMathematicsCodeClub/CardiffMathematicsCodeClub.github.io)

A repository for the Cardiff School of Mathematics Code Club: an extra curricular club open to all.

The website for code club is located here - http://cardiffmathematicscodeclub.github.io/

Meeting time: Thursday's 16:00-18:00 in room M/0.33.

## Runing the website locally

In order to run the website locally you need to make sure you have all the dependencies installed. This repository
uses the [Bundle](http://bundler.io/) ruby gem to manage it's dependencies. To install bundle run the following

```
$ gem install bundle
```

Next you need to have forked this repository, you can do that by clicking the `Fork` button in upper right part
of this webpage. Then clone your fork to your computer by running

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_user_name>/CardiffMathematicsCodeClub.github.io
```

Then once you are in the same folder as this README run

```
$ bundle install
```

That will install everything you need to run this site and the tests. To view your local copy of the website run

```
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

Then open the url given in a web browser to view the site.

Any changes you make to a page should automatically updated when viewing locally. If nothing changes, check the terminal from where jekyll has been run to see if there are any errors.

## Contributing

### Pull Requests

Contributions are made to this site by making [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
if you followed the installation guide above then you should already have your own fork of this repository. You make
changes to you fork and then make a pull request against this repository containing your changes.

But before you do *please* run the tests locally by running the following command from the same folder as the README
```
$ rake
```

### Draft Posts

If you are making a draft post (you can do this by editing a *.md file in the `_drafts` folder)
and want to preview it locally you can run the following.

```
$ jekyll serve --w --drafts
```

The draft blog post will appear as the latest post.

### Code snippets

To embed code snippets into a page it's best to create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) containing
the code, and since we are using Jekyll you can simply add the following to the markdown for that particular
page

```
{% gist <username>/<gist-id> %}
```
so for example if the URL for a particular gist was ```https://gist.github.com/johnsmith/57fd5d7s8fd6``` then
in your webpage you would put ```{% gist johnsmith/57fd5d7s8fd6 %} ```

### Writing tests

The functional tests are class based and all classes include a 'User Story'.
Whenever a new feature/page is added to the site a corresponding test should be written (note that at present not all tests that are needed are written).
In fact 'Test Driven Development' is the correct way to write any code:

1. Write a test
2. Check that tests fails
3. Write feature that stops test from failing

A great explanation of this process is given in [this book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/ch01.html) (free to read online and where the goat image is taken from).
