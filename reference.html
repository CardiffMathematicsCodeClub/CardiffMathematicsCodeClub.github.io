<p> There is so much you can do during your time at Code Club anything
    from learning a new programming languages such as <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/languages/java.html">Java</a>
    or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/languages/haskell.html">Haskell</a> to useful tools such
    as <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> for version control or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/editors/vim.html">Vim</a>
    for text editing to hacking away in <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/?page_id=14">Minecraft</a>
    for the Raspberry Pi! You are only limited by your imagination!

<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
<p>
    There are more programming languages than stars in the galaxy... OK
    <i>slight</i> exaggeration but there are a lot of them. Created for any
    possible purpose imaginable from building video games to driving rovers on Mars or
    simply trying to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/languages/brainfk.html">confuse</a> the programmer using them!
</p>
<p> Some of the more popular languages include <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/languages/java.html">Java</a>,
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/languages/python.html">Python</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/languages/C++.html">C++</a>.
    However there are many more than that! Below are just a sample of them.
</p>
<div class="two-cols">
    <ul>
        {% for pages in site.pages %}

                <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ pages.url }}">{{ pages.title }}</a>
