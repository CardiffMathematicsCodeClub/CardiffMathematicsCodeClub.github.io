                Code club is a place where like minded people who are passionate
                about programming can get together, hang out and work on
                whatever project that takes their fancy whether it be as part
                of a team or solo.
            </p>
            <p>
                However it's also just a great place to spend your early Wednesday
                evening, spending time with those who share your interests with
                plenty of laughs, jokes and games to be had.
            </p>

                However Code Club isn't just a great place to hang out, it's
                also a good opportunity to learn something new and develop your
                skills!
            </p>
            <p>
                We run semi regular <a href="/workshops/index.html">workshops</a> which
                are a great 30 minute introduction into all sorts of topics,
                from the basics of the command line to building web applications
                with Django!
            </p>
            <p>
                We also have a <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a> where you can
                find articles written by our members, anything from general
                code club news to
                <a href="{% post_url 2015-01-16-making-an-app-in-python-using-kivy-1 %}">
                building mobile apps with python and kivy.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Can't find what you're looking for on the blog? Well check out
                our <a href="/reference.html">reference</a> section. In there we
                have language and programming tool overviews, everything you
                need to get on your next project!
            </p>

                Code Club is made by its members for its members,
                if nobody showed up then it would be a very sad place indeed.
                That's why we need you!
                <a href="/getinvolved.html">Get involved</a>, write a blog post,
                submit a theme for the website or even just show up!
            </p>
            <p>
                There will always be someone around willing to help you get
                started, so don't worry about being stuck. The atmosphere is
                always light hearted and sharing experiences is all part of the
                fun. If you are a seasoned veteran or have never written a line
                of code in your life, I promise you, there's a place here for
                you at code club.
