The first rule of code club is to always be encouraging and helpful.

Code club activities are governed by a formal code of conduct. In short,
participants at code club events are expected to contribute to an environment
that is **open** and welcoming, **considerate** and **respectful**.

A fuller statement of these values is given in the [Python Community Code of
Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
